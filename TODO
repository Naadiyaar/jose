==== Bugs

* suggestion arrow colors don't update as they should?
* double click insert variant; trying to delete it

? Charter buggy
? Windows file chooser; worked-around by using LnF. Windows original is desirable.
? antialiasing when running jose.exe vs. java.exe vs. debugger ?

==== Project
compile sources against 1.8 32bit [x]
libraries needed:
* com.sun.codec.jpeg [x] copied from 1.5 (probably not needed anyway)
? TraceConnection probably not needed anyway
* get rid of some outdated stuff (customizing for jdk 1.4, 1.5, plafs, ...)

==== Linux build (!!)
* requires jre 1.8 (i386)
* requires some extra libraries (i386)
    - libXrender.so.1, libXtst.so.6, libXi.so6, libstdc++.so.5
* todo cross-compile easylink for i386. Which extra libaries are needed?
* bin/unrar: either put libstdc++.so.5 into LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or use Linux_x86_64/unrar
==== macOS
* which JDK is running on recent macOS ?
* do we need a 64bit version of mysql-je? Do we already have one?

==== New Features

* BUG? black evals during (after) book phase
* BUG? Leela keeps analyzing while playing from book
* BUG? Leela diagnostics not always associated correctly

* arrows + text label
  - font size?
  - if possible, redraw only modified arrows

* "New Game from here"
  - player names update
  - turn board on engine start
  - BUG fixed ?? engine loses synch. "stop" and "ponderhit" leave ignoreMoves > 0.

* keep playing after flagging ?

* Chessnut
  - beep: after each move
  - flip option with new game ??
  - check mate: fanfare, animation ...

* BUG: engine configurations
  - absolute path to directories?
  - can't delete? (Apply !!)

==== Postponed

* Resign, Offer draw. Current heuristics is similar to TCEC
  - no draw offer before move 30
  - offer/accept draw if drawish for 5 consecutive moves
  - drawish: WDL draw>=99%, or score ~= 0.5
  - resign if: WDL lose>=99% or score <= 0.02

* Contempt Slider
        White seeks a draw - neutral - Black seeks a draw - Armageddon
    -1   ...............        0         ............         +1
        Black avoids a draw            White avoids a draw

    Armageddon = Black seeks a draw at any cost; white avoids a draw at any cost.

? see https://lczero.org/blog/2023/07/the-lc0-v0.30.0-wdl-rescale/contempt-implementation/
 there is some confusion about the effective parameters. Online docu is not up-to-date :(

* score POV adjustable?
  * uci reports current pov
  * UciPlugin "adjusts" pov to white (in the process creating artifacts, like negative win-percentage)
  * panel shows always white pov (might be user-adjustable)
  * eval bar **must** use white pov [0..1]
  * suggestions arrows **must** use current pov * [0..1]

? commentary arrows and highlights
