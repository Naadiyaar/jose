==== Bugs

* suggestion arrow colors don't update as they should
* double click insert variant; trying to delete it
* project urls

? fix Berlin font
? Charter buggy
? Windows file chooser; worked-around by using LnF. Windows original is desirable.
? put fop metrics to ../fop/*.XML. Seems to have file path problems ?
? Text File export not implemented?
? antialiasing when running jose.exe vs. java.exe vs. debugger ?

==== Project
compile sources against 1.8 [x]
libraries needed:
* jdk 1.8 32 bit [x]
* com.sun.codec.jpeg [x] copied from 1.5 (probably not needed anyway)
? TraceConnection probably not needed anyway
* pack & upload jose-15b-win.zip
* check link (remove donate, update, help, ...)
* update download.xml

==== Linux build
? : requires mysql-embedded to be re-compiled for 64 bit.
 -> find a *working* copy of libmysqld for 64 bit ??
(? resize Ubuntu partition on xps 15)

==== Postponed

* Resign, Offer draw. Offering draws is not that trivial.
    WDL, DrawScore and Contempt need to be considered.
    Draws must not be offered too frequently.
    With DrawScore ~= +-1 one side will *always* offer draw, the opponent will *always* decline; which is rather pointless.

* Contempt Slider

        White seeks a draw - neutral - Black seeks a draw - Armageddon
    -1   ...............        0         ............         +1
        Black avoids a draw            White avoids a draw

    Armageddon = Black seeks a draw at any cost; white avoids a draw at any cost.

? see https://lczero.org/blog/2023/07/the-lc0-v0.30.0-wdl-rescale/contempt-implementation/
 there is some confusion about the effective parameters. Online docu is not up-to-date :(

* score POV adjustable?
  * uci reports current pov
  * UciPlugin "adjusts" pov to white (in the process creating artifacts, like negative win-percentage)
  * panel shows always white pov (might be user-adjustable)
  * eval bar **must** use white pov [0..1]
  * suggestions arrows **must** use current pov * [0..1]

? score graph??
* eval bar 3D
? commentary arrows and highlights


==== Interesting Leela settings.
? temperature for more variations in the opening
