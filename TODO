==== Bugs

* double click insert variant; trying to delete it

? fix Berlin font
? Charter buggy
? Windows file chooser; worked-around by using LnF. Windows original is desirable.
? put fop metrics to ../fop/*.XML. Seems to have file path problems ?
? Text File export not implemented?
? antialiasing when running jose.exe vs. java.exe vs. debugger ?

==== Project
compile sources against 1.8 [x]
libraries needed:
* jdk 1.8 32 bit [x]
* com.sun.codec.jpeg [x] copied from 1.5 (probably not needed anyway)
? TraceConnection probably not needed anyway

==== Linux build
? : requires mysql-embedded to be re-compiled for 64 bit.
 -> find a *working* copy of libmysqld for 64 bit ??
(? resize Ubuntu partition on xps 15)

=== Factory Settings

* eval bar
* suggestions

Leela
* logo
* MultiPV = 8 (?)
* VerboseMoveStats = true
* LogLiveStats = true


==== New Features

* Format Leela Move Stats
* Suggestions check box
* Contempt Slider

        White seeks a draw - neutral - Black seeks a draw - Armageddon
    -1   ...............        0         ............         +1
        Black avoids a draw            White avoids a draw

    Armageddon = Black seeks a draw at any cost; white avoids a draw at any cost.

WDLDrawRateReference = 0.58
        draw rate in initial position. Depends on trained net and should not change much
WDLCalibrationELO = 2700
        should be transparent, but is not quite. Contempt has stronger effect on smaller elos
WDLEvalObjectivity = 0.0, or  1 ?

Contempt = 400
        elo difference. this is the main control variable !!
        +100 for Armageddon (is this sufficient? why not more?)

ContemptMode = play, white_side_analysis, black_side_analysis.
        switch to 'play' when actually playing against Leela

WDLContemptAtenuation = 1.0
        should be left at 1.0. Scales Contempt, but why should we?

ScoreType = WDL_mu
        (for compatibilty with Stockfish)


* mouse hover PV: display position (on main board? no. in tooltip is better)

* score POV adjustable?
  * uci reports current pov
  * UciPlugin "adjusts" pov to white (in the process creating artifacts, like negative win-percentage)
  * panel shows always white pov (might be user-adjustable)
  * eval bar **must** use white pov [0..1]
  * suggestions arrows **must** use current pov * [0..1]

? score graph??
* eval bar 3D
? commentary arrows and highlights


==== Interesting Leela settings.
? temperature for more variations in the opening
? contempt for sharp/dull play

Contempt
? see https://lczero.org/blog/2023/07/the-lc0-v0.30.0-wdl-rescale/contempt-implementation/
* there is some confusion about the effective parameters. Online docu is not up-to-date :(

* DrawScore / ContemptMode ?
* WDLDrawRate ?
