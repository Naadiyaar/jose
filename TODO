==== Bugs

* double click insert variant; trying to delete it

[x] print to temporary pdf.
[ ] ...then there is awt (wysiwig) printing. But that has too little layout control, anyway.
    might become deprecated?

[x] bug:
    8/5Q1p/6p1/2n1N1Pk/5P1P/P6K/2q5/8 w - - 1 56
    -> lift Qf7 and Ph7
    [x] don't interpret take-take sequence if there is a plausbile simple move

[x] stop analysis on mate
[x] uci figurines:
     [x] support multi letter (like russian)
[ ] Cut from text
[x] Type N, ? at end of comment

? Charter buggy

[ ] BUG? "go infinite" with only one legal move
    early response "bestmove", but analysis does not arrive at EnginePanel
    instead, outdated analysis is shown
    -> there should be no early response. could be side-effect of another error?!

[ ] Eval Bar, Graph drawing glitches (paintImmediately?)
[?] paint eval bar frame

[?] game vs. opening explorer:
    - user moves have no value (and it shows)

[ ] db: expected data on row ?



==== Project

[x] Java 3D
    1.5 last version from Oracle. Works well for Windows and Linux. Not for Mac
    1.6 from jogamp. better choice for Mac (but not really tested :(
        unreliable on Windows
    1.7 massive API changes. maybe more stable? is it worth a try??

[x] mysql 5.0.67 x64 + myisamchk
    [x] Windows (x) stand-alone
    [x] Linux (x) embeded (x) stand-alone
    [x] Mac intel
    [ ] Mac arm
[x] easylink: 64 bit, use latest hidapi
    [x] Windows: (-) fixes BLE
    [-] Linux builds but don't work

Alternative JREs:
* JBR 21: better hidpi support, but touch&drag bug (which is a showstopper for me).
    if ... that bug gets fixed, JBR would be the top candidate
* Zulu 21: small footprint, but blanks on fractional uiscale
* Oracle 23: seems to work, but don't hurry

==== Deprecated Stuff

* Positional Index !!
  - db fields are NOT USED at all
    -> makes sense because they would increase the db size x8
  - position search is performed exhaustively !?!
    - with shortcut for mat signature
    -> which is a bit dumb but effective

==== Old New Features

* arrows + text label
  - if possible, redraw only modified arrows

* "New Game from here"
  - turn board on engine start (or don't)

* keep playing after flagging ?

* Chessnut
  - beep: after each move
  - flip option with new game ??
  - check mate: fanfare, animation ...

* BUG: engine configurations
  - absolute path to directories?
  - can't delete? (Apply !!)

==== Refactorings

* fine-grained BoardView2D updates
    - 64+2 bits instead of fRedraw
    - set bits selectively when painting/undoing arrows
* double buffering still needed ? (probably)

==== Interesting New Features

* nicer annotation palette
    [x] figurinesymbol: $141 against
    [-] most recent list
    [x] make a demo pgn with all nags.
    [x] print preview
    [x] prints as pdf (font is recognized, font metrics were out-of-date)
    [x] print as html (copy glyphs to disk)
    [x] extra symbols (ucsf, nic, ..)
    [x] type $206
    [x] help page (html)
    [x] bump version 1.5.3
    [ ] ant package jose-153-patch

* font awesome icons

* Logos: User
    [ ] document? (would have to be stored in db :(

* Foldable variations.
    - Use LineLabelNode as buttons
    - no need for extra gui real estate

* Figurines in Opening names (like from Eco)
  - heuristic to detect moves
  - for any language

* Autocompletion for database fields (Event, Player, ...)

* LiChess Opening Explorer
    [ ] MoreGame.ExternalKey (:=Lichess GameId)

* replace Nalimov query with Lichess tablebase query

* Graph View interactive
    [x] mark current move.
    [ ] tooltips
    [ ] click navigate
    [x] use paintImmediately for BoardView2D score?  (instead of repaint!)

* Comment search
    * regex
    * replace

* Contempt Slider
        White seeks a draw - neutral - Black seeks a draw - Armageddon
    -1   ...............        0         ............         +1
        Black avoids a draw            White avoids a draw

    Armageddon = Black seeks a draw at any cost; white avoids a draw at any cost.

? see https://lczero.org/blog/2023/07/the-lc0-v0.30.0-wdl-rescale/contempt-implementation/
 there is some confusion about the effective parameters. Online docu is not up-to-date :(

* score POV adjustable?
  * uci reports current pov
  * UciPlugin "adjusts" pov to white (in the process creating artifacts, like negative win-percentage)
  * panel shows always white pov (might be user-adjustable)
  * eval bar **must** use white pov [0..1]
  * suggestions arrows **must** use current pov * [0..1]

* commentary arrows and highlights
