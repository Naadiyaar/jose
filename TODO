==== Bugs

* paragraph spacing before Diagram
? Charter buggy
? Windows file chooser; worked-around by using LnF. Windows original is desirable.
? put fop metrics to ../fop/*.XML. Seems to have file path problems ?
? fix Berlin font
? Text File export not implemented?
? antialiasing when running jose.exe vs. java.exe vs. debugger ?

==== Project
compile sources against 1.8 [x]
libraries needed:
* jdk 1.8 32 bit [x]
* com.sun.codec.jpeg [x] copied from 1.5 (probably not needed anyway)
? TraceConnection probably not needed anyway

==== New Features
? eval bar
  * fix score perspective: moving party vs. white/black
  * score types (centipawn, percentage, etc.)

? score graph??
* eval bar 3D
? suggestion arrows
? commentary arrows and highlights


==== Linux build
? : requires mysql-embedded to be re-compiled for 64 bit.
Don't think I want to do that...
? clobber Ubuntu on xps 15?

==== Interesting Leela settings.
? temperature for more variations in the opening
? contempt for sharp/dull play
? UCI_showWDL always on
* cp can mean several things: win_percentage, Q, WDL_mu, cp_with_drawscore ??

Contempt
? see https://lczero.org/blog/2023/07/the-lc0-v0.30.0-wdl-rescale/contempt-implementation/
* there is some confusion about the effective parameters. Online docu is not up-to-date :(

* DrawScore / ContemptMode ?
* WDLDrawRate ?

? Make 'contempt' / Armageddon slider controls for Black vs. White and Human vs. Leela ?
