This code was copied from com.sun.j3d.utils.behaviors.interpolators

There was a flaw (?) in KBRotPosScaleSplinePathInterpolator.
Unfortunately, the com.sun.j3d.utils package uses so many private variables that it
is virtually impossible to overwrite class from there !!

That's why I had to copy the code. Modified lines are
KBRotPosScaleSplinePathInterpolator.java 221-256
