* Java Runtime Environment 1.4 or later

  Some installation packages (those with "-jre") 
  already contain the Runtime Environment. 
  It will be installed along with jose (without affecting 
  existing installations).
  
  Alternatively, you can download the JRE from:
    http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp
  Linux users might also have a look at:
    http://www.blackdown.org
  
  If you don't know which version of Java is installed on your system,
  open a command prompt and type "java -version".
  
  Please note that jose will not run with Microsoft's JRE
  (but the installation program will).
