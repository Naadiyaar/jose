this directory contains duplicates and seemingly corrupted files

note that some True Type fonts might cause the JVM to crash (especially in 1.4)
this is definitely a bug inside the JVM's native code but we have to sort out 
the affected fonts, which are:

Lucena			(LUCEFONT.TTF)
Magnetic		(MAGNFONT.TTF)		
Millenia-D		(MILDFONT.TTF)
Motif			(MOTIFONT.TTF)
Mediaeval		(MVALFONT.TTF)
Traveller Standard	(STD.TTF)
Maya			(MAYA_TT.TTF)

you are free to use these fonts but at the risk of crashing the program.
